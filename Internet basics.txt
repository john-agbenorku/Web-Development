What is the internet?  
The internet is a global network of computers connected together, allowing them to share information and communicate using standardized protocols.  

How does the internet work?  
The internet works by connecting computers and devices through servers, routers, and cables (or wireless signals). Data is broken into small packets and sent across the network, then reassembled at the destination.  

What is a domain name?  
A domain name is the human-friendly address of a website (like example.com) that points to its server’s IP address.  

DNS and how it works  
DNS (Domain Name System) is like the internet’s phonebook. It translates domain names (like google.com) into IP addresses (like 142.250.190.14), so computers know where to send data.  

Browsers and how they work  
A browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge) is software that lets you visit and view websites. It takes code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) from servers and renders it into text, images, and interactive pages for you to use.  

What are markup languages?  
Markup languages are computer languages that use tags to structure and format documents. The most common one for the web is HTML (HyperText Markup Language).  

What is front end development?  
Front-end development is the part of web development that deals with what users see and interact with in the browser. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to design layouts, styles, and interactivity.  

What is http?  
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the set of rules for transferring data between a web browser (client) and a server. It’s how websites are requested and delivered.  

What is a browser?  
A browser is an application used to access and display websites on the internet. Examples: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari.  

How do browsers work?  
Browsers send requests (via HTTP/HTTPS) to web servers. The server responds with website files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), and the browser interprets and displays them on your screen.  

How does the web work?  
The web works through clients (browsers) requesting resources from servers using HTTP/HTTPS. Servers send back the files, which browsers render as websites. Links connect these websites together, forming the World Wide Web.
